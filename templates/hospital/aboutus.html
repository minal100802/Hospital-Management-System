    <p class="lead">A service dedicated to Hospital Admin, Doctor and Patient. The Hospital Management System can be accessed through the login page using a username and password. It is accessible by an administrator, doctors and patients. Doctors and patients can make their accounts which is then approved by the admin. Alternatively, the admin can create accounts for the doctors as well as patients. All the data is available to the admin where they can alter the data in the database. 
      The data can be retrieved and is displayed in a systematic manner. The interface is very user-friendly with all the data well protected for personal use, making the data processing very fast. The load on the front desk of the hospital gets reduced drastically.
